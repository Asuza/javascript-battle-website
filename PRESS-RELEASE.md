## Heading ##

A daily artificial intelligence challenge that anyone can join

## Sub-Heading ##

Javascript Battle is for coders of any level that want to compete with and against other developers in a very fun learning environment.

## Summary ##

Every day there is an epic battle between legendary heroes.  Control your hero with your own pre-submitted javascript function (your hero’s “brain”), and see the results of each day’s battle as your hero’s prowess is tested against the competition.

Sign up is as easy as logging into your github account, forking a “starter” repository, and opting in to the daily battle at javascriptbattle.com.  Learn from your past mistakes and make your hero smarter by customizing your code, and feel the power as your hero dominates the battlefield.

Such is the power of javascript.
