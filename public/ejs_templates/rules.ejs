        <li>Follow the steps outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/JavascriptBattle/hero-starter">README</a> to get started.</li>
        <li>Each day your hero's code will be pulled from GitHub and run against other user's code.</li>
        <li>Each hero will be assigned a team at random and will fight for that king that day.</li>
        <li>Your hero will navigate across the gameboard in search of honor and riches in the form of defeating enemies and capturing diamond mines.</li>
        <li>Your hero will need to decide which way to travel depending on the environment. Will your hero run from attack or fight? Will your hero seek out only the riches of diamond mines? Will your hero seek only the glory of combat</li>
        <li>Diamond mines are captured automatically by the game when your hero steps onto a diamond mine tile, but at a cost to your hero's health.</li>
        <li>Enemies are attacked automatically when your hero ends his/her turn next to an enemy (all nearby enemies take damage).</li>
        <li>Moving into a "Health Well" tile will replenish your hero's health</li>
        <li>Teams can win by either 1) Killing every member of the opposing team, or 2) being in possession of more diamonds after 2000 turns.</li>
        <li>Strength and Honor!</li>
